These files compose the database creation, related functions for interacting with the database.
Here's the general structure of the data:
- there are stores, each with their own attributes
- the full Stores table is located in the central_db, as well as each of the two shards
- Vendors contains the information about each of the items in the store_id (note that the shards are split based off of store_id)
    - This table will be queried by store managers
- Customer_Portal contains the information about items in the stores relevant to customers
    - This table will be queried by users

Setting up the code:
- first need to set up MySQL & MySQL Workbench locally (I'd recommend to follow a YouTube video)
    - this is the video I used: https://youtu.be/u96rVINbAUI?si=D_yqLWbq3_UeGTHL
- Check that your Firewall isn't blocking MySQL
- Add MySQL to your PATH
- run central_creation.py, shard_creation.py

Brief file descriptions:
- tables_creation.txt --> details table schemas from script to create tables
- central_creation.py --> creates the database "central_db" that contains the stores and their information
- shard_creation.py --> creates the shard databases (currently only have two). creates Vendor, Customer_Portal, and Stores in each shard
- config.py --> stores connection information
- admin_actions --> this file contains the planned functions that admins (store operators) will use to interact with the data
- customer_actions --> this file contains the planned functions that customers will use to interact with the data

Planned implementation:
- mainly need to create GUI over the functions
- may want to create a users table to distinguish between admin & customer usages
    - i.e redirect to different pages based off credentials entered in a login page
- perhaps will want to structure the databases differently
    - I'm not sure whether Vendor and Customer_Portal really need to be separate tables, for instance
